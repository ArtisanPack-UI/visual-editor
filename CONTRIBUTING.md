As an open source project, Digital Shopfront CMS is open to contributions from everyone. You don’t need to be a
developer to contribute. Whether it’s contributing code, writing documentation, testing the CMS or anything in between
there’s a place for you here to contribute.

## Code of Conduct

In order to make this a best place for everyone to contribute, there are some hard and fast rules that everyone needs to
abide by.

* Digital Shopfront CMS is open to everyone no matter your race, ethnicity, gender, who you love, etc. In order to keep
  it that way, there’s zero tolerance for any racist, misogynistic, xenaphobic, bigoted, Zionist, antisemitic (yes,
  there is a difference), Islamophobic, etc. messages. This includes messages sent to a fellow contributor outside of
  this repository. In short, don’t be a jerk. Failure to comply will result in a ban from the project.
* Be respectful when communicating with fellow contributors.
* Respect the decisions made for what to include in the CMS.
* Work together to create the best possible content management system.
