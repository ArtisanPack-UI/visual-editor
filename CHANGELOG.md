# Digital Shopfront CMS Package Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **cms-framework integration (Phase G).** First-class pairing with [`artisanpack-ui/cms-framework`](https://github.com/ArtisanPack-UI/cms-framework). When both packages are installed, the visual editor can edit cms-framework's `Post` and `Page` content end-to-end; `core/site-*` blocks read from cms-framework's settings store via `apGetSetting('site.*')`; `core/post-*`, `core/archives`, `core/categories`, `core/tag-cloud`, `core/query`, and `core/query-loop` come off the V1 deny-list and resolve against cms-framework's models and term endpoints. Loose coupling preserved — both packages remain usable standalone; cms-framework's editor wiring is guarded by `class_exists(\ArtisanPackUI\VisualEditor\VisualEditor::class)`. Pair-versioning matrix lives in the README; the [`docs/g6-smoke-flow.md`](docs/g6-smoke-flow.md) flow runs against the version pair before every release tag. Full integration contract: [`docs/plans/12-cms-framework-integration.md`](docs/plans/12-cms-framework-integration.md).
- "Using with cms-framework" README section. Covers install, migrations, the merged resource map under `ap.visual-editor.resources`, and the version-pair contract.
- `visual_editor.*` permissions schema seeded into cms-framework's RBAC when both packages are installed (G5). Policies still use the "any authenticated user" baseline in V1.0; delegation lands in V1.1 behind `artisanpack.visual-editor.authorization.delegate_to_cms_framework`.
- `artisanpack/form` block. Dynamic block that lets authors pick a form from the artisanpack-ui/forms package via the InspectorControls sidebar, and renders a `<div data-keystone-form="…" data-form-id="…">` mount-point on the public site. The host application supplies a JS island that hydrates the mount-point with the forms package's React `FormRenderer`. Registration is gated on `class_exists(ArtisanPackUI\Forms\Models\Form::class)` so visual-editor still boots when forms is absent.
- Stale-selection guard in the form block's editor preview. When the persisted `formId` no longer matches any form returned by `/api/v1/forms`, the canvas renders a distinct `<Placeholder>` with a "Reset selection" button that clears the attribute back to `0`. Replaces the previous silent fall-through to the 404 "inactive" message, which mis-coded deleted forms as merely deactivated.

### Changed

- `FormBlock::validateAttrs()` now parses `formId` with `FILTER_VALIDATE_INT` via a `normalizeFormId()` helper. Rejects float strings (`"12.9"`) and scientific notation (`"1e2"`) that `is_numeric` + `(int)` previously truncated into unrelated form ids; non-positive values fall through to the "select a form" placeholder.
- Form block editor preview's 404 error message updated from "This form is inactive…" to "This form is unavailable — it may have been deleted or deactivated." — neutral wording that fits both branches of `FormBlock::render`'s server-side check.
- All `block.json` `textdomain` values aligned with the editor runtime's `TEXT_DOMAIN` constant (`artisanpack-visual-editor`). Translations for block titles/descriptions/keywords now resolve under the same domain as the rest of the editor strings.
