# Digital Shopfront CMS Package Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `artisanpack/form` block. Dynamic block that lets authors pick a form from the artisanpack-ui/forms package via the InspectorControls sidebar, and renders a `<div data-keystone-form="…" data-form-id="…">` mount-point on the public site. The host application supplies a JS island that hydrates the mount-point with the forms package's React `FormRenderer`. Registration is gated on `class_exists(ArtisanPackUI\Forms\Models\Form::class)` so visual-editor still boots when forms is absent.
