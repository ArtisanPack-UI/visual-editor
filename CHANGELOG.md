# Digital Shopfront CMS Package Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `artisanpack/form` block. Dynamic block that lets authors pick a form from the artisanpack-ui/forms package via the InspectorControls sidebar, and renders a `<div data-keystone-form="…" data-form-id="…">` mount-point on the public site. The host application supplies a JS island that hydrates the mount-point with the forms package's React `FormRenderer`. Registration is gated on `class_exists(ArtisanPackUI\Forms\Models\Form::class)` so visual-editor still boots when forms is absent.
- Stale-selection guard in the form block's editor preview. When the persisted `formId` no longer matches any form returned by `/api/v1/forms`, the canvas renders a distinct `<Placeholder>` with a "Reset selection" button that clears the attribute back to `0`. Replaces the previous silent fall-through to the 404 "inactive" message, which mis-coded deleted forms as merely deactivated.

### Changed

- `FormBlock::validateAttrs()` now parses `formId` with `FILTER_VALIDATE_INT` via a `normalizeFormId()` helper. Rejects float strings (`"12.9"`) and scientific notation (`"1e2"`) that `is_numeric` + `(int)` previously truncated into unrelated form ids; non-positive values fall through to the "select a form" placeholder.
- Form block editor preview's 404 error message updated from "This form is inactive…" to "This form is unavailable — it may have been deleted or deactivated." — neutral wording that fits both branches of `FormBlock::render`'s server-side check.
- All `block.json` `textdomain` values aligned with the editor runtime's `TEXT_DOMAIN` constant (`artisanpack-visual-editor`). Translations for block titles/descriptions/keywords now resolve under the same domain as the rest of the editor strings.
