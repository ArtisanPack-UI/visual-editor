# Visual Editor Documentation

Welcome to the ArtisanPack UI Visual Editor documentation! This Laravel package brings the WordPress Gutenberg block editor to any Eloquent model and ships a full site editor for templates, template parts, global styles, navigation menus, and patterns.

## Overview

The Visual Editor is designed to give Laravel apps a first-class block-based authoring experience. It provides:

- **Post editor** — A Gutenberg-powered block editor for any Eloquent model that opts in via the `HasBlockContent` trait
- **Site editor** — WordPress-style templates, template parts, `theme.json`-backed global styles, navigation menus, and patterns; mounted at `/visual-editor/site`
- **42 forked core blocks** under the `artisanpack/*` namespace — content, media, layout, widget, entity, loop/feed, comments, and query/pagination clusters
- **Three renderer packages** — Blade (PHP, server-side), React, and Vue — for rendering saved block content on the public site
- **Custom blocks** — Authoring API for shipping your own static or dynamic blocks under any namespace
- **Responsive design tools** — Per-breakpoint values on block controls, resolved through a theme-aware breakpoint registry
- **Interactive state tools** — Per-state (hover, focus, active, disabled, custom) overrides on block controls
- **Media bridge** — Pluggable picker + upload bridge that routes Gutenberg's `MediaUpload` hook through any host media library
- **Livewire & Inertia recipes** — Drop-in embedding patterns for both stacks, plus the same browser-event contract regardless of host
- **First-class pairing** with [`artisanpack-ui/cms-framework`](https://github.com/ArtisanPack-UI/cms-framework) for Post / Page / site-meta / navigation / global-styles persistence — both packages remain usable standalone
- **Pluggable access gate** — Fail-closed `SiteEditorAccessGate` contract for the site-editor surface; bind your own to integrate with any RBAC

### Site Editor

The surface for editing site-wide chrome — templates, template parts, global styles, navigation menus, and patterns. Mounted at `/visual-editor/site`. Requires [`artisanpack-ui/cms-framework`](https://github.com/ArtisanPack-UI/cms-framework).

- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /patterns` — Synced and unsynced patterns
- `GET /global-styles/lookup`, `GET /global-styles/base`, `GET /global-styles/css`, `GET/PUT /global-styles/{id}` — Global styles
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /menus`, `/menu-items`, `GET /menu-locations` — Navigation

### Other

## Version Compatibility

The visual editor and `artisanpack-ui/cms-framework` ship as a version pair — both packages need to be present and on a compatible major version for the site-editor integration to work.

| visual-editor | cms-framework | Notes                                          |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| v1.x          | v1.x          | Site-editor integration (this release)         |
| v0.x          | v0.x          | Pre-v1 — no site-editor integration            |

Bumping the major on either package without bumping the partner is unsupported.

---

## Configuration

The editor uses a single configuration file:

```php
// config/artisanpack/visual-editor.php
return [
    'resources' => [
        'posts' => App\Models\Post::class,
    ],
    'api' => [
        'middleware' => ['api', 'auth'],
    ],
    // ...
];
```

See [[Configuration]] for the full reference.
